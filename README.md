# Hello world! 🌍  
I'm @Armiron Kurbalaj, a software engineer who loves building Fullstack Applications from backend to frontend to mobile and desktop.

## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a full-time **Fullstack Developer** working mainly on the **backend** of big, complex, microservices-based software that sends up to **300 million SMS a month**. On my free time, I enjoy learning and building applications that push the limits of what technology can do.

I'm mostly **self-taught** and started my journey with University. However, I realized the traditional path didn’t align with my career goals, so I decided to focus on learning more relevant and modern technologies to meet my objectives. I've been developing professionally since **July 2021**.

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack  
**Languages:**  
- JavaScript (Node.js), TypeScript, Dart (Flutter)

**Backend Frameworks:**  
- Express.js, Fastify

**Frontend Frameworks:**  
- React, Vue.js

**Databases:**  
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

**DevOps/Tools:**  
- Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines

## 💻 What I Love to Build  
I enjoy building **full-stack applications** with a **scalable and reliable backend**. My favorite projects are often **engaging applications** like **chat apps** and **social media platforms** that allow me to explore both technical challenges and user experience.

## 🌱 Learning & Growing  
I’m always experimenting with new technologies and adding to my toolset. Most of my learning projects are public on my GitHub, where you can see my progress. Although my more complex projects are private, they help me stay on the cutting edge of modern application development.

## 🎧 Fun Facts  
I love coding at night with some background **lofi music**. It’s incredibly fulfilling to watch my lines of code turn into a working application after solving so many complex problems along the way. It's the little wins that keep me going!

## 📬 Let's Connect
